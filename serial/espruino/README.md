# Espruino LED toggle

This sample lets you toggle the state of an LED on an [Espruino JavaScript board](http://www.espruino.com) as well as reading back its current temperature. The board runs JavaScript, so it's easy to control it by sending JavaScript commands directly to it as strings.

1. Ensure that the line `DEVICE_PATH=` at the top of `main.js` matches Espruino's path
2. Install and launch this packaged app.
3. Press either one of the two buttons
